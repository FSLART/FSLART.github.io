# LART | Formula Student Team 
# Autonomous Driving Department

Our team, LART, was founded in 2006. We designed and manufactured three vehicles so far: one in 2006, another in 2014, and the most recent one in 2024.

At the moment we are designing our first electric and autonomous vehicle. This concept won the first place at FSPT.

Considering the trends of the automotive market and the growth of autonomous mobility, we want to be placed in the forefront and ready to develop meaningful work as soon as we leave university.

## Our autonomous concept

Our autonomous concept is camera-only. We use a stereo camera. With this, we can detect and classify the cones using a convolutional neural network, and from the depth sensing of the camera get the cones position in 3D space.

Considering our concept is camera-based and the cone detection neural network is a core part of it, having CUDA cores and dedicated acceleration is a plus. This is the reason why we chose to use a computer from the Jetson family.

## Open Source ❤️

We are commited to the advancement of both the formula student driverless community as well as the autonomous robotics community in general, which is the reason why we make our codebase publicly available in [GitHub](https://github.com/FSLART).

## Technology stack

We use a variety of technologies to make our concept reality. Below are the most significant.

### Languages

- C++
- Python

### Frameworks and Libraries
